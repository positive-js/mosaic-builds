Uses no SVGs or complex animations.\n * Note that theming is meant to be handled by the parent element, e.g.\n * `mc-primary .mc-pseudo-checkbox`.\n *\n * Note that this component will be completely invisible to screen-reader users. This is *not*\n * interchangeable with `<mc-checkbox>` and should *not* be used if the user would directly\n * interact with the checkbox. The pseudo-checkbox should only be used as an implementation detail\n * of more complex components that appropriately handle selected / checked state.\n * @docs-private\n */\nexport declare class McPseudoCheckbox {\n    state: McPseudoCheckboxState;\n    disabled: boolean;\n}\n"]}
